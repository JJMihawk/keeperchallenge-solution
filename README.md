# Keeper of the Seven Keys - Java coding challenge

* Full name: Juan José Gómez Jiménez
* Email adress: juanjogmzj@gmail.com
* Basic description of my solution:

    The keeper remembers the paths that he has seen without exploring and go to them in reverse order of viewing.
    When he see the door, he start to remember the way that he follows to be able to return when he has the seven
    keys.


    **NOTE:**    I added the hashCode method to the Position class to allow the correct performance of the equals
                method.
